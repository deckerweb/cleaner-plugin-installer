## Description

> #### Cleaner Start Page for "Add Plugins" (Installer)
> A LARGE search box to find plugins for installing more easily and way faster.
>
> No clutter. The regular content of the "Featured" tab was removed: not the 6 same old plugin cards cards any longer and no useless tag cloud anymore!
>
> Plus: set the number of displayed plugin cards per page via "Screen Options" tab (on top right corner).


### Scratching My Own Itch
As of WordPress 4.0+, going to "Add Plugins" page and being welcomed by always the same old 6 featured plugin cards annoyed me big time! So I thought on how to change this default behavior. Due to WordPress' genius Hooks & Filter functionality I could easily tweak this via my plugin.

Now it starts with what should have been the default (in my opinion) from the beginning: a large and nice plugin search box - because that's what I do all the day :). Side benefit: better performance as no external plugin card content has to be loaded!

*And there you have it, a one-purpose admin helper plugin aiming at (super) administrators and webmasters searching for and installing plugins from WordPress.org repository on a daily basis.*

**Own translation/wording:** For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/cleaner-plugin-installer/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that, just use a language file like `cleaner-plugin-installer-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the tools on "Other Notes").


## Frequently Asked Questions


### Does this plugin replace the built-in "Featured" tab?
Yes, but only its content! The page query parameter `?tab=featured` was left untouched! This way all works as before, if you access the `plugin-install.php` admin page, but you'll be welcomed with a big search input field.



### What's the benefit of this curated Topics list with plugin tags?
In my opinion this helps to find specific plugins (within certain areas, topics, use cases...) a lot faster - via your admin area. For example, clicking on "TinyMCE" will list you all plugin cards tagged (by their authors) with "tinymce".

The original built-in plugin tag cloud is way to generic, so I removed it.

**Note:** Manually curated tag lists for a lot of plugin types, use cases and popular plugin solutions. Listing here maintained by David Decker (plugin author of "Cleaner Plugin Installer"). Tag itself are from plugin's readme header.



### Why the Collections tab for "WPCore"?
Glad you asked :). This is a bit more experimental, I guess. However, in my opinion, the WPCore plugin and service are incredible useful, so I thought of some basic integration. This could help to jump faster to WPCore functionality if the service is already active. If it is not active yet, users are informed about it and can install and register for it super fast. This may help users get aware of an alternative for collecting & managing their favorite plugins - and bulk installing them on any installation.

**Disclaimer:** "I am NOT affiliated with 'WPCore' in any way, other than that, being a normal user of their service & plugin. 'WPCore' is a community effort aiming to make some things a bit easier for a lot of administrators and webmasters." *â€”David Decker, author of "Cleaner Plugin Installer" plugin*



### Why the additional "Newest" tab?
I think it is really useful to easily check for the newest additions on WordPress.org plugin repository without leaving your admin area. Also great for test installations to just install a brand new plugin and try it out! :)



### Can I suggest new topics and tags for the "Topics" tab?
Absolutely! Just open a new thread in the [support forum **here**](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/cleaner-plugin-installer) and let us know your feedback! Thank you!



### How can I remove the "Collections" tab?
This is easily possible with a little code snippet added to a *functionality plugin*, *snippet manager* or to your theme's/ child theme's `functions.php`:

`
add_filter( 'install_plugins_tabs', 'custom_cpi_plugin_installer_tabs_tweaks', 15, 1 );
/**
 * Plugin: Cleaner Plugin Installer
 * Remove "Collections" tab.
 *
 * @param  array $tabs
 *
 * @return array Array of (tweaked) plugin installer tabs.
 */
function custom_cpi_plugin_installer_tabs_tweaks( $tabs ) {

	unset( $tabs[ 'collections' ] );

	return $tabs;

}  // end function
`

**---> Note:** I only recommend using a custom functionality plugin, or snippets manager plugins like ["Code Snippets"](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) or ["Toolbox"](https://wordpress.org/plugins/toolbox/). --- Customizing your `functions.php` is always dangerous and at your own risk! You may experience a crashed site plus lots of trouble when changing your theme/ child theme afterwards. Also, any generic admin functionality has no place in your theme!



### How can I remove the "Topics" tab?
Possible, via the above code for "Collections" tab: you only have to add the following line after the first "unset" line (or replace this line with that):
`
	unset( $tabs[ 'topics' ] );
`



### What does the "Slim Mode" do?
For power users this is to remove/ hide the following things:

* Remove help texts on the "Start: Search" tab
* Remove help texts on the "Topics" tab
* Remove the "Collections" tab completely
* Remove the help texts on the "Uploader" page
* Remove the notice on the Multisite plugins installer page
* Remove the plugins counter entry on the Dashboard widget


### How do I activate the "Slim Mode"?
That is relatively easy, just add the following code snippet to your `wp-config.php` file or a functionality plugin:
`
/**
 * Plugin: Cleaner Plugin Installer - activate Slim Mode.
 */
if ( ! defined( 'CPI_SLIM_MODE' ) ) {
	define( 'CPI_SLIM_MODE', TRUE );
}
`

## Changelog


### 1.4.0 (2016-09-12)
* NEW: Finally, added the "Recommended" tab to the installer toolbar (was originally introduced with WP 4.2, yes I know...!)
* UPDATE: Fixed search functionality for starting page of the installer -- it's not the most ideal fix but as of now it's working again, which matters. (Backstory: in WP 4.6 they introduced Ajaxified installer behavior for the search function and we cannot easily modify it, sadly!)
* UPDATE: Re-added the original search form (top right in the installer toolbar) for all installer tabs except the starting page - reason: makes more sense to have search field always visible. I made the change based on my own usage and behavior and I guess it fits better overall...! :-)
* UPDATE: Removed the plugin search functionality from the Dashboard widget for WordPress versions 4.6 or higher (due to the changes in WP 4.6+, sadly).
* UPDATE: Updated German translations and also the `.pot` file for all translators.


### 1.3.0 (2014-11-02)
* NEW: Now also supporting "WPFavs.com" bulk plugin installer service ([GPL plugin at WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpfavs/)) - in addition to "WPCore.com".
* NEW: Added support for plugin ["Upload Larger Plugins" (free, by David Anderson)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/upload-larger-plugins/), regarding our tweaked uploader page (which will hide gracefully once this other plugin is active).
* NEW: Added plugin search field to "At a Glance" Dashboard widget - comes in really handy :-).
* NEW: Also added plugin search field to "Right Now" Dashboard widget in Multisite's Network admin.
* NEW: Added links and counters for active and total installed plugins to "At a Glance"/ "Right Now" Dashboard widgets - great for admins to get a first overview plugin-wise :).
* NEW: Added (current) version number of plugins to plugin card overview.
* NEW: Added "Slim Mode" to the plugin; to be activated via constant - it removes/ hides a few help texts etc. for power users [see FAQ section here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cleaner-plugin-installer/faq/ "See in FAQ section for more info ...") for more info on that, and how to activate!
* UPDATE: Moved all visual arrows over to CSS! This also means simplified and improved RTL languages support in removing all PHP-tweaking from RTL-related things (beyond the stylesheet loading).
* UPDATE: Added Dashicon icon to our own Help Tab section link to make clear this is additional and not for Core help texts.
* CODE: Added `$page = 1` to all our tab functions to be 100% compliant with WordPress Core functions expecting this.
* CODE: More refinements, fixed PHP notices, minor enhancements, code documentation.
* UPDATE: Added 3 new screenshots.
* UPDATE: Updated and improved `readme.txt` file here.
* UPDATE: Updated German translations and also the `.pot` file for all translators.


### 1.2.2 (2014-10-29)
* UPDATE: Fix "Topics" tab screen options display correctly in Multisite.


### 1.2.1 (2014-10-29)
* NEW: Added new "Screen Option" to the "Topics" tab for setting the search type to "keyword": that means, the linked tag lists will trigger a search for the keyword ("term") instead of the "tag" search. This might bring other/ better/ whatever different search results. It's a per user setting. *--- Mad props to [Brady Vercher](https://profiles.wordpress.org/bradyvercher) of [Blaser Six, Inc.](http://www.blazersix.com/) for contributing the core code for this feature!*
* NEW: Added a few subtle CSS tweaks to the Thickbox modal window when opening a plugin card (details view). So hopefully you'll find that "install button" a bit better and faster now, and maybe like the donate link better :-).
* UPDATE: Make the plugin cards per page setting also available for the optional "Beta Testing" tab.
* UPDATE: Various small improvements, mostly regarding, code organization, (inline) code documentation and `readme.txt` file.
* UPDATE: Updated German translations and also the `.pot` file for all translators.


### 1.2.0 (2014-10-27)
* NEW: Bring back the submit button for the original search bar in the toolbar (only visible when performing a search).
* UPDATE: Tweaked the large search form on the "Start: Search" tab even more: now fully mobile optimized as well - smoother overall performance :).
* NEW: Added 2 new curated topic tags to the "Topics" tab.
* NEW: Added compatibility plus basic styling for RTL languages (Right-To-Left direction languages).

* NEW: Added `:hover` styling for any instance showing "plugin cards" - this way you can better visually distinguish those cards!
* NEW: All markup and CSS way better optimized for smaller displays and mobile usage.

* UPDATE: Various small improvements, mostly regarding, code organization, (inline) code documentation and `readme.txt` file.

As of WordPress 4.0+ the new plugin installer start page was annoying me. By scratching my own itch here I came up with this plugin ;-). I hope you enjoy it as much as I do :).
